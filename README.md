### Project Description
Ever wanted your pillow to judge your sleeping habits?
Meet the BuzzBed Buddy ‚Äî a pillow that listens to your snoring and shakes its head (well, your head) in disapproval. It doesn‚Äôt stop your snoring forever, but it will annoy you just enough to make you roll over and pretend you don‚Äôt snore. Perfect for anyone who thinks peace and quiet are overrated.

### The Problem 
   Snoring ‚Äî nature‚Äôs way of turning peaceful nights into a live concert nobody asked for. While the snorer enjoys a free front-row ticket to dreamland, everyone else is stuck listening to a remix of chainsaws, motorboats, and foghorns. Over time, this ‚Äúnightly soundtrack‚Äù can be more than just annoying; it can hint at serious health issues like sleep apnea, which sneakily steals energy, focus, and even heart health.

 Most anti-snoring gadgets are either torture devices in disguise or bank-account bullies. Wearables can feel like sleeping with a mini robot strapped to your face, and loud alarms just make everyone in the room grumpy. Clearly, the world is begging for a gentler, friendlier, and cheaper way to give snorers a polite nudge‚Äîwithout turning bedtime into a full-blown wake-up call for the whole neighborhood.

### The Solution 

 A pillow with superpowers ‚Äî it hears you snore and politely tells you to ‚Äúshhh‚Äù without using words. Inside, there‚Äôs a sneaky little sound sensor that waits for your midnight chainsaw to start. The moment you begin your greatest hits album of Zzz & Rrrrr, a tiny vibration motor gives you a gentle nudge, like a sleepy friend saying, ‚ÄúHey buddy, roll over.‚Äù

 No masks, no alarms, no wrestling with weird gadgets in the middle of the night. Just a comfy pillow that quietly keeps the peace while you sleep like royalty ‚Äî minus the royal trumpet fanfare in your nose. It‚Äôs cheap, friendly, and might just save your relationships‚Ä¶ or at least your roommate‚Äôs sanity.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Ardunio IDE

For Hardware:
1. Arduino Board ‚Äì Acts as the brain of your project (Arduino Uno or Nano recommended).
2. KY-038 Sound Sensor ‚Äì Detects the snoring sound.
3. Flat Button-Type Vibration Motor ‚Äì Gently vibrates the pillow when snoring is detected.
4. Relay Module or Transistor ‚Äì To control the vibration motor safely.
5. Jumper Wires ‚Äì For all the connections between components.
6. Breadboard ‚Äì For prototyping the circuit before final assembly.
7. Power Supply / Battery Pack ‚Äì To run the Arduino and motor (e.g., 9V battery or rechargeable pack).
8. Pillow / Cushion ‚Äì The cozy home for all the magic.
